# Jamboree Education - Casestudy (Linear-Regression)
Jamboree has recently launched a feature that estimates the chances of graduate admission into Ivy League colleges for students, specifically from an Indian perspective. The goal of this analysis is to identify and understand the key factors that influence admission decisions and how these factors interrelate. By analyzing historical admission data, we aim to build a predictive model that estimates a studentâ€™s probability of gaining admission based on factors such as academic performance, standardized test scores, extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation, and other relevant metrics.
